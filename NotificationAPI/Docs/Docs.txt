The following are the packages I used, though I believe they are auto injected when opening the project on another computer.
Requirements:
	add sendgrid dependencies:
		dotnet add paclage SendGrid
		dotnet add package SendGrid.Extensions.DependecyInjection
		dotnet add package RestSharp
        dotnet add package System.ComponentModel.Annotations

		Note: must be within project folder or nuget PM console


API KEYS:

    the api keys and appropriate authorzation should be added to the launchSettings.json file.
    The following elements were added.

    "ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT": "Development",
    "SENDGRID_URI": "https://api.sendgrid.com/v3/mail/send",
    "SENDGRID_API_KEY": "123",
    "TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID": "123",
    "TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN": "123"
    
    I named them to be very straight forward.  The twilio does not need a URI endpoint since it uses the .NET package.





Usage/Testing:
		
    I used Insomnia REST Client to complete the requests to the API.  I am sure that Postman or any other is fine.  I just like the Insomia slogan...  "Never worry about REST again"

    SendGrid:
       endpoint: https://localhost:44356/api/SendMail
       json formatting:  see Docs/SendMail.json


    Twilio: 
        endpoint: https://localhost:44356/api/SendText
        json formatting: see Docs/SendText.json
